          <h1>Evolution not revolution</h1>
          <p class="fw-bold fs-italic text-end"> - An approach which has less risk on your business</p>
          <p>
            In the fast-paced world of software development, change is inevitable. As new technologies emerge and
            business needs evolve, it becomes necessary to update the architecture of software applications. However,
            the process of architecture change is not as simple as tearing everything down and starting from scratch. It
            requires careful planning, consideration of priorities, and a strategy for migration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first point to consider when approaching architecture change is the approach to take. Rather than a
            revolution, a gradual evolution is recommended. A revolution can be risky and may disrupt the existing
            system. A gradual approach allows for incremental changes to be made, reducing the risk of failure and
            ensuring that the architecture evolves in a controlled manner. This approach is especially relevant when
            working with legacy systems, which require a delicate balance of preservation and modernization.
          </p>
          <p>
            When making an architecture change, there is often a choice between prioritizing new features or technology.
            It's important to choose one and stick to it. While product managers may argue that they get nothing new
            from a technology change, technology can enable new features, improve performance, and simplify maintenance.
            Therefore, it's suggested that technology change should be prioritized over new features. It's also
            important to ensure that engineers do not change features during the architecture change process. Changing
            features adds complexity and may increase the risk of failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Migration is often the most challenging part of architecture change. Before embarking on a migration, it's
            essential to consider whether migration is necessary or whether it's feasible to avoid it. If migration is
            necessary, it's important to have a migration plan in place. The plan should include a clear understanding
            of what needs to be migrated, how it will be migrated, and how the migration will be tested. It's also
            important to communicate the migration plan to customers and stakeholders to manage expectations and
            minimize disruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, architecture change is an essential aspect of software development. It's important to
            approach architecture change gradually, prioritize technology over features, and carefully plan migration.
            By following these guidelines, developers can ensure that the architecture of their applications evolves in
            a controlled and effective manner, enabling them to keep pace with the evolving needs of their business and
            customers.

          <h1>It is not as important as you think to reuse the code</h1>
          <p>Code reuse is often seen as a best practice in software development, as it can lead to significant time and
            cost savings. However, it is not always as important as you might think. In some cases, reusing code can
            actually lead to more harm than good, especially when it comes to tight coupling and architecture
            principles.</p>
          <p>

            One of the most important principles of software architecture is the idea of cutting big and complicated
            stuff into smaller and independent pieces. This helps to make your code more modular and easier to maintain,
            as each piece can be tested and modified independently without affecting the rest of the system. When you
            reuse code, you run the risk of introducing tight coupling, which can make it harder to modify and maintain
            the code over time.</p>
          <p>

            Another challenge with reusing code is that business logic is often difficult to reuse because it frequently
            changes. In order to effectively reuse code, you need to watch very carefully to find the stable parts and
            separate them from the parts that change frequently. This can be a time-consuming and difficult process, and
            it may not always be worth the effort.</p>
          <p>

            Despite these challenges, there are still some best practices that can help you effectively reuse code in
            your software development projects. One of the most important is to focus on building business-independent
            components, such as timezone utilities, string libraries, and other utility functions. These types of
            components are less likely to change frequently, and they can be reused across a variety of projects and
            applications.</p>
          <p>

            In addition to building business-independent components, it is also important to follow good coding
            practices that promote code reuse. This includes using a consistent coding style, commenting your code
            effectively, and making your code as modular as possible. By following these best practices, you can help
            ensure that your code is reusable and maintainable over time.</p>
          <p>

            In conclusion, while code reuse can be a valuable tool in software development, it is not always as
            important as you might think. Reusing code can introduce tight coupling and other architectural challenges,
            and it can be difficult to find stable parts of your business logic to reuse. However, by focusing on
            building business-independent components and following good coding practices, you can effectively reuse code
            and build more maintainable and scalable software over time.</p>
