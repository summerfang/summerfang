        <p>Summer Fang is a seasoned engineering leader and currently serves as the Senior Director of Engineering at
          Cisco, where he is responsible for the development of Webex Webinar. With Summer's expertise, the Webinar
          capacity has scaled to accommodate up to 100,000 attendees.</p>
        <p>Prior to his current role, Summer served as the Engineering Leader for Webex China, where he managed all
          engineers in Cisco Webex in China. In 2019, he relocated to the US to focus on building a new portfolio for
          the
          collaboration product family. Summer was one of the founding engineers of Webex, and he has been working on
          the
          product for over 23 years. Summer is proud of building a world-class engineering team in China, where he
          established strong processes for improving efficiency, including transitioning Webex's release cycle from 10
          months to a monthly release - a now standard release cycle of Webex.</p>
        <p>Summer is also a technical enthusiast and
          enjoys writing code. His GitHub account is https://github.com/summerfang. He is currently studying machine
          learning technology, and believes it will usher in a
          new era for the next 30 years. Summer firmly believes that no product can survive without AI features in the
          future.</p>
        <p> Outside of work, Summer is passionate about sports, especially soccer and table tennis. He lives in the Bay
          Area
          with his wife and daughter, who is currently enrolled in a Master's program for Data Science at the University
          of Southern California - a source of great pride for the family.

          In addition to his love for technology, Summer is also interested in science, literature, history, politics,
          culture, and religion.
